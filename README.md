# Seat-Tracker
This application is to keep track of employees in a development center to avoid the manual work that the teams come across in every offshore ODCS in a company.

<b><h4>Below are the scenarios where Leads are facing challenges:</b></h4>
<ul>
  <li>Each time a new Bee joins the account, SPOC has to manually collect the data.</li>
  <li>Employees moved from one location to another location in the same/different ODC.</li>
  <li>Employees moving out of the account makes inconsistent data.</li>
  <li>Collecting data across all ODC will also depends on availability of people based on time.</li>
  <li>Also maintaining the data to be accurate is one huge task for a SPOC during seat tracker preparation.</li>
</ul>

For the same I have come-up with this solution which will minimize the work efforts for a SPOC & to maintain accurate data in the seat tracker sheet.
